#Wordcount Lab

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```plain
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```

## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\wordCount.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.

##Notes

You should get familiar with javascript classes, prototyping, returning, and conditional statements.

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes are required. Prototyping of the Array class will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
